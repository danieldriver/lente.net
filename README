# Lente.net

Lente.net is the open-access press behind the Journal for Scripture &
Theology. The word is a Latin adverb meaning "slowly," as in the old
saying and oxymoron *festina lente*: make haste slowly. Since it's an
internet publication, the *festina* part is taken as read.

# Technical Details

For the sake of access and durability, the site's code and the
contents of its publications are released on GitHub. This has several
benefits, and it is one of the factors behind the decision to compile
the site with [Jekyll][jekyll], the static site generator used to
build GitHub pages.

[Pandoc][pandoc] is another key component (its [source][jgm]). It
allows the editors to automatically transform plain-text files written
in [markdown][df] --- or, to be precise, a [superset of markdown][pandoc-md]
with enhancements useful for academic writing --- into a variety of
formats, including HTML, PDF (via LaTeX), and ePub.

Jekyll does not support pandoc natively, which unfortunately means
that GitHub can only serve as an imperfect mirror of Lente.net.
Happily, the [jekyll-pandoc-multiple-formats][fauno] plugin provides
the necessary functionality in other environments. A word of warning,
though: the pandoc plugin makes jekyll processor hungry, particulary
when multiple formats are requested. It is generally not desirable to
use the plugin while running `$ jekyll --server --auto`.

LaTeX is an *éminence grise* in open-source software, and it is widely
used in the academy --- though still not very often in biblical and
theological studies. It allows one to produce photo-ready PDFs of very
high quality. (It works on all major platforms. Mac users, get 
[MacTeX][mactex].) Thanks to pandoc, it can take a much simplified 
markdown file as an input as well.

For digital machinery, then, Lente.net relies on the following:

  * git (version control)
  * jekyll (site generator)
  * pandoc (article format conversion)
  * LaTeX (generation of PDFs)

Finally, the publication uses David Březina's [Skolar typeface][skolar]
in the generation of its PDFs, and also licences it for web display. This
is the only aspect of the site that is not open source.

# Take a Look Without All the Dependencies

For friends of the site with web development skills, I'd welcome your help.
Take a look at demo.html, in the root directory. It's a pre-compiled mockup
of an article, and it calls on assets in the /-/ folder.

Thanks for any input!

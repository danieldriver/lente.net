One of the perennial attractions of Calvin and Barth’s approach to
biblical interpretation lies in their commitment to the total verbal
witness of Scripture, *including its tensions*, as the indispensable
basis for the ecclesial task of theological exegesis.  Although both
these interpreters are often charged with letting *a priori* theological
commitments drive their exegetical conclusions, taken at their best one
finds a certain resistance toward the exegetical temptation to resolve
the biblical material too quickly into one theological category or
another.  While this resistance is itself grounded in a theological
conviction, namely, that we as exegetes must not seek for a kind of
resolution inappropriate to our status as creatures, recognizing the
reality of this resistance helps us appreciate the nature of the
tensions in their own approaches to reading Scripture.   In their own
distinctive ways, both men recognized that while theological categories
are often helpful for coming to terms with Scripture’s literal sense,
they must not be allowed to override the tensions one faces as he or she
seeks to do justice to the total witness of Scripture.   In the best
examples of this exegetical mentality in Calvin and Barth, one finds a
willingness to simply let such categories stand alongside one another
rather than seek for a harmonizing solution to ‘surface irregularities’
in the text.

It is one of the many merits of Daniel Driver’s fine study of Brevard
Childs as *biblical* theologian to have provided us with a compelling
case for the family resemblance Childs’ exegetical practice shares with
the best interpreters of Christian scripture in this respect,
interpreters not limited, of course, to Reformed figures such as Calvin
and Barth, but also including interpreters from premodernity and the
more critically minded voices of early and late modernity.  Viewed from
this perspective, the internal tensions in Childs’ canonical
approach --- tensions that his many critics have not hesitated to point
out --- appropriately reflect his own convictions regarding the canon of
Scripture, especially the nature of its theological witness.  

The portrait of Childs that emerges from Driver’s study has many rich
facets, though arguably Childs’ sophistication and complexity as a
reader of Scripture most often stands in the foreground. The Christian
scholar and biblical exegete who stands center stage in Driver’s work
looks askance at harmonizing approaches to Scripture which seek to
overcome its internal tensions, whether by recourse to dogmatic
categories or to historical reconstructions,[^1] because such approaches 
inevitably overlook the fact that the biblical text has been structured
with these tensions.  As such, these tensions belong to the theological
witness of the material and should not smoothed out or rendered
‘seamless’ by exploiting categories now readily available in the wake of
the modern novel’s rise to fame (e.g., story, narrative,
intertextuality).  Nor should one seek to overcome these tensions in the
kindred realm of the relationship between the two testaments, attempting
thereby to overcome the irreducible space between them.  For Childs,
this space has to do with the discreteness and integrity of each
testament vis-à-vis the other, and thus one should not seek to
transcend  the dialectical relationship it reflects by means of an
appeal to the exegetical techniques of late Second Temple Judaism (e.g.,
midrash), nor for that matter, its ‘worldview’ or traditions.  Both the
literary and historical discreteness of the two testaments must be
respected, while at the same time recognizing their unifying reality is
to be found outside themselves in the theological reality (*res*) to
which they both bear witness, namely, the Triune God revealing himself
in Christ by his Spirit.  

[^1]: Although Childs advocated the use of modern historical methods to
‘sharpen’ our understanding of Scripture’s final form, he was also aware of
their limits, especially their potential for aiding historical critics in
pursuing their own forms of ‘harmonization.’ Thus he writes: “To work from
the final form is to resist any method which seeks critically to shift the
canonical ordering.  Such an exegetical move occurs whenever an overarching
category such as Heilsgeschichte subordinates the peculiar canonical
profile, or a historical critical reconstruction attempts to refocus the
picture according to its own standards of aesthetics or historical
accuracy” (Childs, *Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture*
[Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1979], 77).

Such tensions, Driver properly notes, are also the inevitable
consequence of Childs’ understanding of the scope of the biblical
theological task.  One way of construing Childs’ approach to biblical
scholarship is to view it as a late modern survival of the earlier
concern for comprehensiveness still present in biblical scholarship at
the birth of modernity, a vision *ironically* eclipsed by early
modernity’s concern to do greater justice to the complexity of the
Bible’s historical dimension.  Driver’s study helpfully reminds us that
Childs did not seek to escape this complexity by retreating into a
wholly synchronic approach to interpreting Scripture.  However, neither
did he surrender the concern for comprehensiveness that characterized
the theological vision of premodernity, a vision which continued for
some time into the early modern period before finally being sublimated
by the rise of historical consciousness.  Childs’ attempts[^2] to hold on to
the best of the past while fully embracing the complexities of the
present is precisely what made his task a lonely one in the 20^th^
century, a task beset with criticisms from both the left and the right
end of the theological spectrum. In light of the ‘silo mentality’ that
continues to characterize late modern biblical scholarship, his
comprehensive biblical theological vision caused not a few working in
the biblical guild to view him as a bit of a throwback or anachronism,
or as Driver himself puts it, “a brontosaur who survived cataclysm only
to plod through a smouldering landscape.”

[^2]: For an account of the various ways in which early modernity’s concern
for comprehensiveness came to be replaced by an almost exclusive concern
for specialization in biblical scholarship, see the discussion in
Christopher R. Seitz, *Prophecy and Hermeneutics: Toward a New Introduction
to the Prophets* (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2007).

It seems clear to this reviewer that Driver’s study surpasses a number of
earlier efforts, both British and American, to come to terms with Childs’
work.  The book itself constitutes a ‘thorough revision’ of a doctoral
thesis completed and defended by Driver while a PhD student enrolled in St.
Mary’s College at the University of St. Andrews (Scotland).  Published in
2010 by Mohr Siebeck, the text is largely written in English, though it
also cites a fair number of German sources that are translated only in an
appendix to the Baker edition of 2012.  Driver’s study provides a virtually
exhaustive bibliography of Childs’ writings and secondary sources related
to Childs, along with Scripture, author, and subject indexes.  The
exposition of the book itself is simply too rich to be recapitulated within
the confines of this brief review, let alone given the careful critical
interaction it deserves.  For this reason it will be necessary to attempt a
brief summary of the chapters, then discuss a few of the issues raised by
this fine piece of research.

In the first chapter we find an overview of the scope of Driver’s book,
as well as interesting discussion of some of Childs’ earliest
form-critical reflections on the book of Exodus, reflections undertaken
in 1952 while still a PhD student in Basel under Walter Baumgartner. 
Driver’s discussion demonstrates that Childs’ lifelong appreciation for
the complexity involved in negotiating the subtle relationship between
the biblical text and its historical referent(s) began during his
postgraduate years while still a fledgling student of form-critical
method in the tradition of Gunkel.  In this way Driver’s study lays the
groundwork for a reading of Childs that avoids the one-sided, simplistic
readings of him offered by critics such as James Barr and John Barton. 
In the second chapter Driver provides helpful overviews of the English
*and* German reception of Childs’ work.  Some of the more representative
examples in the English treatments of Childs’ work Driver critically
surveys include John Barton, Paul Noble, Mark Brett, and William Lyons,
while the survey of German assessments include Manfred Oeming, Rolf
Rendtorff, and Georg Steins.  

While Childs’ arch critic James Barr is not given a lengthy treatment in
chapter 2, he is given a fairly high profile in chapter 3.  The chapter
helpfully illustrates the differences between Barr and Childs regarding
the issue touched upon at the outset of this review, namely, the proper
scope of biblical theology.  In the course of his long career, Barr
often advanced the criticism that Childs’ version of biblical theology
was too ambitious and therefore guilty of overreach, a charge he often
expressed by criticizing those who (like Childs) wrongly confuse
biblical theology with a “pan-biblical theology” derived from
theological reflection on both testaments.  By recourse to Rolf
Rendtorff’s critical interaction with Childs, Driver successfully
demonstrates that for all Barr’s grousing about Childs’ alleged
departure from a German Protestant model for doing biblical theology,
his two-testament approach to biblical theology (rather than Barr’s
downsized model) properly finds its impulse and home in the German
Protestant tradition.  At the same time, Rendtorff’s discomfort with
Childs’ reading of the Old Testament *as Christian Scripture* is
discussed briefly, a topic which Driver explores in greater detail in
the latter half of chapter 6.

In chapter 4, antecedents to Childs’ canonical approach in Gunkel’s
form-critical method are expounded and clarified.  A persistent failing
in North American treatments of Childs’ work has been their inability to
properly appreciate the parameters of the theological and hermeneutical
problematic Childs inherited from his form-critical training in Germany,
especially von Rad’s theologically charged use of form-critical method. 
Driver rightly recognizes that a nuanced appreciation of the subtleties
inherent in Childs’ understanding of Scripture’s ‘final form’ turn upon
a proper appreciation of his modifications of form-critical method in
light of his distinctive concept of canon.  Chapter 5 then turns to a
discussion of Childs’ relationship to various forms of narrative
theology, the burden of which is to document the theologically serious
nature of the differences between Childs and the burgeoning school of
narrative hermeneutics in the late 1980s.  Driver duly notes Childs’
increasing disillusionment with the Yale School’s tendency to valorize
non-referential theories of meaning, especially his disappointment with
Frei’s later turn toward ‘midrash as a text-creating reality,’ a move
which on Childs’ view could only further exacerbate the tendency toward
collapsing the distinction between biblical text and external
theological referent at work in narrative hermeneutics.

In a later section of this chapter Driver also evaluates Childs’
critique of approaches that share a family resemblance with the
text-centered dynamics of midrash, for example, the intertextual and
inner-biblical approaches to exegesis found in biblical interpreters as
diverse in background as Walter Moberly, Georg Steins, and Michael
Fishbane.  Childs resists the ‘anti-dialectical’ tendency, inherent in
both midrash and intertextuality, to reduce two things to one by
blurring their discreteness and integrity.  For this reason, Childs
finds figuration rather than midrash more amenable to the character of
Christian Scripture, inasmuch as figuration is a form of sense-making
which respects the gaps and spaces between two texts, persons, or events
in Scripture, rather than seeking to overcome them.  Figuration is thus
capable of uniting two different things while at the same time
preserving their distinct and discrete characteristics.  In sum,
figuration does not suffer from the ‘anti-dialectical’ impulse to
overcome differences which seems to be driving midrash and
intertextuality.

In this reviewer’s opinion, chapter 6 is the best chapter in the book. 
There Driver reflects upon Childs’ growing discomfort with the
exegetical technique of midrash as a way of comprehending the
integrative logic of Scripture, particularly in the wake of the versions
of midrash found in James Sanders’ *Christian* approach and Jacob
Neusner’s *Jewish* approach.  Childs notes that midrash or proto-midrash
tends to remain in the realm of the concrete by ‘moving between two
texts rather than seeking a hidden semantic level below or above the
written corpus.’  While this tendency is commendable from one point of
view, especially since it resists the *behind the text* mentality of
historicism, from another point of view it is troubling, because its
text-centered dynamic tends to dispense with the contribution the text’s
*res* or theological referent makes to its meaning.  On a Christian
reading of the two-testaments, biblical texts do their sense-making, not
merely with reference to other texts, but also with reference to a
particular theological reality, namely, the Triune God revealing himself
in Christ.  Midrash as an exegetical technique thus provides an
insufficient basis for a Christian reading of Scripture, inasmuch as it
operates with a ‘text-text’ dialectic rather than a ‘text-*res’*
dialectic for unifying Scripture.  The end result of operating with this
‘text-text’ dialectic, whether in the form of midrash, intertextuality,
or inner-biblical exegesis, is to surrender the Christian claim (albeit
controversial) that Scripture necessarily presupposes a *particular*
theological reality in order to do its sense-making.  However, if
biblical texts can do their sense-making apart from any need to relate
them to a specifically Christian theological referent, then it follows
that they do not authorize, let alone require, a specifically Christian
reading.  One must therefore conclude that the early church was wrong to
insist on reading the Old Testament as *Christian* Scripture.

Childs’ unease with midrash as a form of ‘oral Torah’ would move him to
reflect more fully on the significance of allegory for the practice of
biblical theology.  For Childs, all Christian reading of Scripture is
allegorical *in the broad sense* that it ‘finds meaning by moving to
another level beyond the textual.’ Allegory says one thing, but means
another, that is to say, in the course of doing its sense-making, it
points to something other than itself.  At the same time, that which it
points to, while distinct from or ‘other than’ the text, is not foreign
to the text.  In this broader approach to defining allegory, Childs
concludes that the logic of allegory rather than midrash is how the
church ultimately addresses the unity of its testaments.  Unlike the
‘text-text’ dynamic at work in midrash, allegory highlights the primacy
of Scripture’s theological subject matter for its sense-making, and thus
points to the fact that the unity of the testaments is not primarily
textual or historical in the first instance, but ontological, rooted and
grounded in the theological reality of the Triune God.  Whatever
excesses may be said to have arisen from allegorical readings of
Scripture do not ultimately erase allegory’s continuing usefulness for
reminding the church that the particular theological ontology required
by Scripture’s overall coherence is primary rather than secondary for
the way in which Scripture delivers its sense and achieves its effect
upon the people of God, both in Israel and the church.  Viewed from this
broader perspective, allegorical sense-making is reflective of a
‘text-res’ dialectic essential to Scripture’s ability to do its
sense-making, as well as its ability to constrain its readers through
the exercise of divine volition.

Childs’ rehabilitation of the concept of allegory naturally leads to a
discussion in chapter 7 of the differences between James Barr and Childs
on this issue, while chapter 8 concludes the work by illustrating
various aspects of Childs’ hermeneutic by using the reception history of
Psalm 102, both ancient and modern, as a sort of comparative foil. 
Following chapter 8 Driver provides a sort of summary judgment regarding
the degree to which Childs succeeded in pursuing his comprehensive
vision, particularly his struggle to read the Old Testament as Christian
Scripture while also wrestling with ‘the mystery of Israel,’ a theme in
Childs’ work which Driver previously wrestled with in chapter 6.  At the
end of the day, he judges Childs’ project largely successful, though he
does register a number of caveats.  In now remains to add a few caveats
of my own.

One small caveat concerns the impact of British influences upon Childs’
concept of canon.  Although Driver mentions the British Old Testament
scholars Peter Ackroyd and Ronald Clements at various junctures in the
book, he doesn’t explore the question whether their notion of a
‘canonical principle’ at work in the tradition building process of
Scripture exerted an influence upon Childs, and if so, to what extent. 
In his published dissertation titled *The Law and the Prophets*, Stephen
B. Chapman notes that both Ackroyd and Clements directly cite Otto
Eissfeldt’s *Einleitung* as an early source for the recognition that ‘a
canonical principle’ was already at work in oral tradition, prior to its
written phase.  Eissfeldt sought the prehistory of the concept of canon
in the development of oral tradition, and this opened to the door to “a
form-critical insight into the nature of religious tradition” as
governed by a canon-consciousness, one which Eissfeldt himself
apparently failed to follow through on.[^3]  In light of these
considerations, Driver’s tendency to focus almost exclusively upon the
significance of Leo Seeligmann’s notion of *Kanonbewusstsein* for
Childs’ approach may be a bit top-heavy.

Testament Canon Formation* (FAT 27; Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2000) 20--23; cf.
esp. 44--45, n. 136; cf. Peter Ackroyd, “Continuity: A Contribution to the
Study of the Old Testament Religious Tradition,” in *Studies in the
Religious Tradition of the Old Testament* (London: SCM Press, 1987) 13--14,
notes 47 and 49; James Sanders, “Adaptable for Life: The Nature and
Function of Canon,” in *From Sacred Story to Sacred Text: Canon as Paradigm*
(Philadelphia: Fortress, 1987) 14.

One also wonders whether Driver’s account of the inner tension in
Gunkel’s method as a conflict between ‘religious atavism’ and modern
concerns with ‘progress’ penetrates to the heart of the exegetical issue
for Gunkel.   Progress for Gunkel is not so much a matter of
*overcoming* cultural primitivism --- indeed, in one respect his romanticism
leads him to glory in its pure, childlike spirit --- but of *reconciling*
the spiritual and religious claims of that primitivism with the need for
an objective basis to measure scientific and cultural progress.  Like
Kant before him, Gunkel is concerned with eliminating speculation in his
chosen discipline and placing it on ‘the sure path of a science.’ 
However, if one cannot locate a method that somehow ensures scientific
objectivity, a standard for commensuration is not possible by which to
adjudicate competing exegetical claims, the result being that a basis
for measuring scientific progress is also lost.  Gunkel rightly saw the
need for an objective stance, but attempted to detach that stance from
the witness of the canon by using form-critical method to separate the
biblical text from its theological subject matter, the latter of which
forms the ultimate ground for the Bible’s ability to do its objective
work.  His efforts to make use of history as a critical control upon
dogmatic speculation proceeded upon the basis of the assumption that the
Bible itself is the problem: it lacks the scientific potential or
objective ability to delimit the range of acceptable interpretations and
constrain its reading audience in terms of those canonically established
parameters.  

Gunkel’s concern is justified insofar as it recognizes the need, like
Gabler recognized before him, to address the tendency of dogmatic
propositionalism to widen the gap between Scripture and theological
reflection.  However, he ultimately fails to take seriously the
potential that canonical Scripture --- understood here as a witness to and
broker of the *full* history of revelation --- has for correcting the
problems inherent in ‘dogmatic propositionalism.’ Having rightly
identified a problem in biblical interpretation, he turns to history as
an ‘objective control’ because he, like many moderns, has ultimately
lost confidence in the Bible’s own ability to broker its intentions and
true subject matter to us.  This is ultimately why, for Gunkel, the
Bible’s witness to the final (or full) form of revelation’s history must
be correlated, not with its divine subject matter, but with a
form-critical typology in order to do its sense-making and somehow
guarantee its scientific potential to provide  objective meanings
unfiltered by confessional commitments.  In sum, Gunkel’s exegetical
project ultimately foundered, not so much because of the inner tensions
Driver describes, but because of his failure to appreciate the canon’s
own scientific potential to act as an ‘objective control’ upon biblical
exegesis, a potential it possesses because of its dialectical relation
to the Triune God.  A good case can be made that this failure on
Gunkel’s part was inextricably bound up with his naturalizing of
Scripture and the biblical doctrine of revelation,[^4] as well as his 
marked resistance to letting canon be the final arbiter of the
contribution tradition history makes to biblical meaning in its oral,
written, and redactional phases.[^5]

[^4]: Driver’s own discussion freely acknowledges Gunkel’s retooling of the
traditional dogmatic understanding of ‘revelation’ along naturalistic lines
(107).

Driver’s discussion of the differences between Childs and Hans Frei with
respect to biblical referentiality also raises some questions for this
reviewer, especially in light of the series of largely unpublished
clarifications on this topic Frei himself made toward the end of his
career.[^6]  For the most part, Driver’s analysis largely overlooks Frei's
own attempts to distance his approach to biblical narrative from “story
theology” and various versions of narrative ontology that omit the
importance of referent for the Bible’s truth claims.  Driver’s critical
comparison of the views of Childs and Frei on this topic draws upon a
number of comments made by Childs in a seminar on Barth convened at Yale
in 1969, as well as Frei’s 1983 essay "The Literal Sense: Will it
Stretch or Break?"  The latter essay rightly caused consternation on
Childs’ part, but it is also important to bear in mind that the essay
was an initial and rather provisional attempt to give expression to
Frei’s growing realization during the decade of the 1980s that something
more than reading the Bible as “realistic narrative” was involved in
gaining access to Scripture's literal sense.[^7]  Here one must keep in mind
the hermeneutical path Frei traversed from the 1974 publication of
his*Eclipse* to his 1983 essay on “The Literal Sense,” then to his 1986
Thompson Memorial Lecture at Princeton Seminary, a lecture given just
two years prior to his untimely death in 1988.[^8]

[^6]: Reference to a number of these clarifications may be found in chapter
8 of Mike Higton’s book *Christ, Providence, and History: Hans W. Frei’s
Public Theology* (London: T & T Clark International, 2004) 177--220. See also
the quotes Higton provides in Appendix 5 of his book titled “Frei and Story
Theology.” On the whole, Higton’s book does a fair job of demonstrating
that Barth's lack of a positive role for history troubled Frei, and that
despite the popular image of Frei as a ‘narrative ontologist’ with
ahistorical tendencies, Frei sought to develop a narrative christology
aimed at addressing this lack. For an example of the way in which this
concern works itself out vis-à-vis Barth’s doctrine of the resurrection,
see the discussion in George Hunsinger, “The Daybreak of the New Creation:
Christ’s Resurrection in Recent Theology,” *SJT* 57:2 (2004) 163--181.

[^7]: Mike Higton argues that Frei’s work during the early 1980s manifests
an increasing unwillingness to rest content with a theology of Christian
self-description that sacrifices the public truth claims of the Gospel (see
Mike Higton, *Christ, Providence, and History*, 208).  He notes that while
Frei’s view of narrative has often been associated with a ‘textual
fideism’, Frei himself regarded such a position to be ‘absolutely wrong’
(209); cf. also the similar comments of Paul J. DeHart, *The Trial of the
Witnesses: The Rise and Decline of Postliberal Theology* (Oxford: Blackwell
Publishing, 2006) 31.

[^8]: This 1986 lecture was published posthumously as “Conflicts in
Interpretation: Resolution, Armistice, or Co-existence?” *Theology Today*
49:3 (1992) 344--356.

In the biblical form of hermeneutical realism promoted in *The Eclipse*,
the real meaning of the biblical text resides in the words or *littera*
of the text rather than a reconstructed historical event or religious
consciousness said to be lying behind or in front of the text. 
Narratives that do their sense-making in terms of what they ‘say’ rather
than what they are about or ‘refer’ to were styled ‘realistic
narratives’ by Frei.  In a realistic narrative, the words of the text
are not secondary ‘husks’, projections, illustrations, or regional
instances of a deeper-lying, original ‘kernel’ of identity, meaning, or
general consciousness.  Rather, the words of a realistic narrative
constitute that meaning and identity, *hermeneutically* speaking.[^9] With
respect to its depiction of Christ, the biblical text is not an
illustration of something more fundamental, but an identity description
with a uniquely ‘unsubstitutable’ integrity of its own.  As such,
biblical narrative does not need to be correlated with the wider
structures of plausibility, meaning and truth on offer in general
theories of biblical interpretation before it can do its sense-making,[^10]
but rather does its sense-making off the back of its own literary form,
as it were.  

[^9]: Incidentally, this is what Frei means when he says that “Jesus is his
story.” Frei is obviously not speaking of an identity of being, for he
clearly recognizes that persons are not texts, and texts are not persons. 
The identity Frei has in view is an identity of sense relations or meaning. 
Frei does not collapse the distinction between the narrative Jesus and
the historical Jesus. What he means to say is that while the person of
Jesus clearly subsists outside biblical narrative, it is impossible to
state who Jesus is apart from this narrative.

[^10]: DeHart suggests that the tendency to identify Frei’s approach to
biblical narrative with an irrational fideism and a general retreat into a
private language game governed by wholly internal and ‘incommensurable’
grammatical rules was facilitated by the tendency of thinkers such as Gary
Comstock and Werner Jeanrond to uncritically identify Frei’s theological
hermeneutics with the textual fideism inherent in Lindbeck’s version of
intratextuality. Related concern over ‘the sectarian temptation’ inherent
in Frei’s critique of correlationalism and general hermeneutics also
emerged from David Tracy and other members of the so-called ‘Chicago
school.’ See Paul J. DeHart, *The Trial of the Witnesses*, 34--35. 
Especially illuminating in this respect is DeHart’s comment that David
Tracy tended to treat the positions of Frei and Lindbeck as
“interchangeable variants on a late ‘Barthianism’ which Tracy can hardly
mention without a hint of scorn.” 

Readers familiar with Barth’s attack on the tradition of general
hermeneutics will recognize his influence upon Frei at this point. 
Indeed, one way to come to terms with Frei’s 1974*Eclipse* is to read it
as narratival extension of Barth’s concern to safeguard the
particularity of biblical revelation.  Scriptural revelation need not be
correlated to history, religious consciousness, or a general
hermeneutical theory before it can do its sense-making, contrary to the
correlationist logic Barth famously attacked in nineteenth-century
hermeneutics.  However, the referential theories of meaning undergirding
nineteeth-century romantic hermeneutics and its historical-critical
counterpart proceeded upon this very assumption.  Frei’s concept of
realistic narrative was thus offered as a narratival antidote to a
similar set of hermeneutical issues addressed by Barth’s dogmatics.  

In later years, however, Frei began to worry about the role played by
realistic narrative in his own hermeneutical approach.  To be sure,
‘correlationism’ wrongly assumed that biblical narratives need to be
correlated with a general theory of interpretation before they can do
their sense-making, but could it be that the general category of
realistic narrative falls prey to the same problem?  Does the category
of realistic narrative effectively function as a general theory of
interpretation, to which biblical texts must ‘refer’ or be correlated
with in order to do their sense-making?  Moreover, in light of the
troubling approaches to referentiality and truth claims evident in the
rising schools of narrative hermeneutics and deconstruction during the
late 1970s, by the decade of the 1980s Frei began to realize more
clearly the need to reorient his discussion of biblical narrative from
the Barthian critique of correlationism he pursued in *The Eclipse*
(albeit appropriate for its time) to an account that does more justice
to the role played by external referent(s) in Scripture’s sense-making. 
This brings us to Frei’s 1983 essay on “The Literal Sense.”

After mounting a lengthy and fairly technical critique of Ricoeur’s
phenomenological approach to biblical hermeneutics, Frei advances a
rather brief and tentative argument at the end of the essay suggesting
that while correlation with an external reality is required for biblical
texts to do their sense making, the appropriate correlation is not
Scripture’s historical referent or the reader’s consciousness, but with
the Christian communal *use* of Scripture.  From this point on Frei
begins to speak of a literal *reading* of Scripture rather than
continuing to speak of its literal *sense*, a change in terminology
adopted to reflect the fact that readers of Scripture inevitably
approach the Bible with a set of hermeneutical or ‘grammatical rules’
for reading it, rules that are ultimately derived from their respective
faith communities.  As Driver notes, Frei arrived at this conclusion in
part as a result of reading Childs’ 1977 essay on the *sensus
literalis*, especially Childs' discussion of Ralph Loewe's work on
*peshat*.  Loewe pointed out that the meaning denoted by the “plain
sense” in Jewish readings was never the simple result of an unmediated
reading Scripture’s literal sense, but rather a function of the
traditional rules adopted by Jewish communities for reading the literal
sense. 

While Frei did not directly identify this use of Scripture with a
cultural-linguistic grammar (Lindbeck), or with rules embedded within
language paradigms (Wittgenstein), his idea of a ‘ruled reading’ of
Scripture clearly makes use of ideas borrowed from both these thinkers,
and Wittgenstein’s ‘meaning is use’ dictum in particular.  Thus while
Frei makes use of the term ‘midrash’ to describe his program, the
obvious influence of both Lindbeck and Wittgenstein makes any
straightforward appeal the dynamics of biblical midrash somewhat
problematic.  Frei’s use of the term ‘midrash’ was undoubtedly
ill-advised.  However, it is important to note that Frei was interested
in this topic because it reflected a certain *public* or *social
sensibility* for reading texts, a way of exegeting and learning the
meaning of texts by drawing upon a shared vocabulary of exegetical
practice that operates within, but not in isolation from, a larger
social and public sensibility.   By using the broader and more vague
term ‘sensibility’ rather than consciousness or experience,[^11] Frei hoped
to incorporate both public and private aspects of the religious reading
of biblical texts, and in so doing address the problem of the relation
between *Glaube* and *Wissenschaft*, or Christian communal
self-description and the public claims of science.  In this way he hoped
to counter the charge that his approach to biblical narrative amounted
to little more than backing into a canonical ghetto of self-contained
meaning and referentiality.

[^11]: Cf. the discussion in Higton, *Christ, Providence, and History*, 182--183.

Moreover, by the time Frei delivered his 1986 lecture at Princeton
Seminary, one can clearly discern his discomfort with the growing
tendency in secular literary theory to bracket out any and all concerns
with a text’s external referent(s): “I agree with the structuralists and
post-structuralists that we should treat textuality (what is written)
and the referent or truth of the text (what is written about) as two
different things and that we should be cautious about saying that one
is, in principle, more important than the other. I do not say, finally,
that they have no bearing on one another.”[^12]  What then was Frei’s view of
the relation between the biblical text and its referent(s)?  Whatever
else one might say about the differences between Frei and Barth on
matters of history, it would appear that their views on this topic were
more or less identical.  Like Barth, Frei recognized that the relation
between a biblical text and its referent was not straightforward or
simple, partaking of something like a one-to-one correspondence.[^13] 
Because of complicated nature of the relation between the two, Frei is
reluctant to move prematurely “from text to truth or language to
reality,”[^14] urging biblical interpreters instead to exercise due caution:

[^12]: Frei, “Conflicts in Interpretation,” 352--353. David Lee summarizes
Frei’s approach to the relation of text and referent as follows: “For Frei,
the pre-critical way is inadmissible for in the contemporary context, it
would seem to require the reader to agree [with] an uncritical correlation
between the narrative and the events described, and so misrepresent what is
meant by the ‘literal sense’ of the text. The ‘modern’ approach is
inadmissible, for it makes the extra-textual referent more important than
the text itself, reducing the function of the text to an ‘evidential’ role,
and so dissolving the literal sense. Finally, the typical postmodern
position which does not take an interest in the literal sense is
inadmissible because it procedurally declares the impossibility of truth or
reference” (David Lee, *Luke’s Stories of Jesus: Theological Reading of
Gospel Narrative and the Legacy of Hans Frei* (JSNTS 185; Sheffield:
Sheffield Academic Press, 1999) 41 n. 72.

[^13]: With respect to Barth’s view of the relation between the biblical
text and its referent, John Webster notes that “G. Hunsinger is correct to
suggest that Barth’s understanding of the way in which the biblical text
refers is not ‘literalist,’ in that Barth denies any ‘perfect coincidence’
between the text and its mysterious, ineffable referent” (G. Hunsinger,
“Beyond Literalism and Expressivism,” 209, 220; cited in Webster, *Barth’s
Ethics of Reconciliation* [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995] 30
n. 31).

[^15]: Ibid., 356.

Frei also follows Barth in the practice of using the category of
‘witness’ (rather than story) to describe the relationship between Jesus
Christ the *Word* and the biblical or written *word*:

[^16]: Ibid., 354.

Reflecting on this passage, Mike Higton suggests that in Frei’s later
work he “began to reinsert his understanding of realistic narrative, now
arrived at by way of Christian self-description, within a more or less
Barthian doctrine of the Word of God.  The grounds for a narrative
reading of the Gospels like that which he pursued in *Identity* are
intra-Christian, but they are not simply the accidental whims of the
Christian community: they are supported by, and make sense within, the
framework of Christian doctrine.”[^17]  Why Frei himself did not develop his
thoughts on this subject as fully as one might have wished remains a
matter of speculation.  Perhaps it was because he was chiefly concerned
to insist that our understanding of Christ the Word be governed and
shaped the primacy of the literal sense rather than vice versa.  Or
perhaps it was because he died before he was able to give a mature
expression of his views on the matter.  To be sure, Frei’s initial 1983
attempt to supplement his Barthian critique of correlationism with an
appeal to midrash was unfortunate.  However it cannot be maintained
unequivocally that Frei was unaware of the crucial role played by the
theological referent of the biblical text (i.e., the Word himself).  
Thus while Driver sums up his discussion of the differences between
Childs and Frei on these matters by suggesting that Childs rather than
Frei “comes closer to Barth’s conception,” this reviewer remains
unpersuaded.  This is not to say, of course, that Frei himself did a
stellar job of clearing himself of the charge that his approach to
biblical narrative undermined Scripture’s truth-telling function. 
However, one can say that the distance between Barth, Childs, and Frei
on this matter is perhaps not as great as some have assumed.  In
closing, it is helpful to recall remarks made by Joe Mangina in a review
of Higton’s work:

[^17]: Higton, *Christ, Providence, and History*, 206.

[^18]: Driver, 157.

[Frei] is often credited with the invention of something called
narrative theology. In later years Frei was to become thoroughly
disenchanted with the term "narrative" and its close cousin, "story",
worrying that these could easily become one more modern way of
displacing God with the human subject.  He hated fads, and feared that
he might have started one himself.  It is one of the many virtues of
Mike Higton’s *Christ, Providence, and History: Hans W. Frei’s Public
Theology* that it manages to liberate Hans Frei from his narrative
captivity.[^19]

[^19]: Joseph Mangina, “Review of Mike Higton’s Christ, Providence, and
History,” *International Journal of Systematic Theology* 8:1 (2006) 91--94,
quote from 91. Driver’s reading of Frei also might have benefited from
interaction with Paul J. DeHart’s 2006 discussion of Frei.  In addition to
taking proper note of Frei’s resistance to being interpreted as the father
of narrative theology, DeHart also recognizes the importance of taking into
account important distinctions and differences between Frei and Lindbeck. 
See Paul J. DeHart, *The Trial of the Witnesses: The Rise and Decline of
Postliberal Theology* (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2006) 31--32; cf. also
his later remarks on 40, 54--55, and esp. 242ff.

This brief overview and response to Driver’s book cannot begin to do
full justice to its subject matter.  For this reason I strongly
recommended that readers interested in these topics pursue the book for
themselves.  Coming to terms with the nuances of Childs’ approach to
canonical hermeneutics can be a daunting task, not only because of the
breadth of Childs’ vision, but also because of the sheer volume of his
writings.  Though some of Childs’ writings do a better job than others
when it comes to introducing readers to contours of his approach to the
Old Testament (e.g., *Old Testament Theology in a Canonical Context*),
it is safe to say that the task of gaining a nuanced understanding of
his work requires one to make his or her way through the bulk of his
major writings, not to mention his many essays and articles covering
specialized topics.  In this respect, Daniel Driver has placed us all in
his debt.  His study provides us with a competent treatment of the most
important (and controversial) dimensions in Childs’ approach, bringing
together material from the entire breadth of Childs’ writings not
readily accessible in summary form elsewhere, and for this he is to be
commended.
